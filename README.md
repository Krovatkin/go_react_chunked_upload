Chunked upload with React/Typescript and Go. The example is adapted from https://www.eventslooped.com/posts/chunked-file-upload-typescript-react-go/

* `templates/upload.html` splits out the TS part of uploader into `upload.tsx`
* `upload.html` needs to be opened locally but requests go to localhost
